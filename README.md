- About Me

As a junior web developer with a focus on Web and Mobile App Development, I have gained hands-on experience in creating robust applications using Spring Boot for back-end development, alongside Android and Flutter for mobile platforms. My journey began with a strong interest in coding and user experience, leading me to explore the full software development lifecycle.

In my projects, Iâ€™ve built RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, which has honed my skills in Java and microservices architecture. On the mobile side, Iâ€™ve developed intuitive applications using Flutter, allowing me to create cross-platform solutions that deliver a seamless user experience. Iâ€™m passionate about clean code and adhere to best practices, ensuring maintainability and scalability in my work.

Collaboration is key in my approach, and I enjoy working within a team to brainstorm ideas and tackle challenges together. Iâ€™m constantly learning and staying updated with industry trends, eager to incorporate new technologies into my projects. My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that enhance user engagement while continuing to grow my expertise in both web and mobile development.
